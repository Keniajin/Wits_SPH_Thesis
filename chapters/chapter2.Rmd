### 2.5.1 
Exploratory Data Analysis  2.5.1 and include equation that is not referenced

In general the seasonal autoregressive moving average model is defined as;  
$$
\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
{\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
\text{ARIMA}\\
{}
\end{array}}\\
{}
\end{array}\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
{\left( {p,d,q} \right)}\\
{\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
 \uparrow \\
{{\text{\tiny{Non seasonal}}}}
\end{array}}
\end{array}{\rm{ }}\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
{{{\left( {P,D,Q} \right)}_s}}\\
{\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
 \uparrow \\
\text{\tiny{seasonal}}
\end{array}}
\end{array}
$$



In general SARIMA model with period $s$ is defined as;

\begin{equation}
\begin{matrix}
   \left( 1-{{\varphi }_{p}}L \right)  \\
   \begin{matrix}
   \uparrow   \\
   \text{NS AR(1)}  \\
\end{matrix}  \\
\end{matrix}\begin{matrix}
   \left( 1-{{\theta }_{1}}{{L}^{s}} \right)  \\
   \begin{matrix}
   \uparrow   \\
   \text{S AR(1)}  \\
\end{matrix}  \\
\end{matrix}\begin{matrix}
   \left( 1-L \right)  \\
   \begin{matrix}
   \uparrow   \\
   \text{NS D}  \\
\end{matrix}  \\
\end{matrix}\begin{matrix}
   {{\left( 1-{{L}^{s}} \right)}_{yt}}  \\
   \begin{matrix}
   \uparrow   \\
   \text{SD}  \\
\end{matrix}  \\
\end{matrix}\begin{matrix}
   =  \\
   {}  \\
\end{matrix}\begin{matrix}
   \left( 1+{{\phi }_{p}}L \right)  \\
   \begin{matrix}
   \uparrow   \\
   \text{NS AR(1)}  \\
\end{matrix}  \\
\end{matrix}\begin{matrix}
   {{\left( 1+{{\Theta }_{1}}{{L}^{s}} \right)}_{{{\ell }_{t}}}}  \\
   \begin{matrix}
   \uparrow   \\
   \text{S AR(1)}  \\
\end{matrix}  \\
\end{matrix}

### 2.5.2 S

## 2.6 Inferential Statistics
### 2.6.1  Inferential Statistics 1
Include inline eqautions like this $x+y=x+y$ ....

#### Model Definition and include equation
The definition of the negative binomial spatial model is
\begin{equation}
\left. {{y}_{ijt}} \right|{{\psi }_{ijt}},\underset{\scriptscriptstyle\thicksim}{\Omega }\sim{\ }\pi \left( \left. {{y}_{ijt}} \right|{{\psi }_{ijt}};\underset{\scriptscriptstyle\thicksim}{\Omega } \right)
\label{eq:binom1}
\end{equation}


###2.6.2 Inferential Statistics 2 
Our outcome for objective 3 ...

#### Model Definition

Since our outcome is binary the general distribution is;
$$
{{y}_{i}}=\left\{ \begin{matrix}
   1  \\
   0  \\
\end{matrix} \right.\begin{matrix}
   \text{if there was a death}  \\
   otherwise  \\
\end{matrix}
$$



### 2.6.3 Model assesment and goodness of fit
We adopted both multilevel models and Bayesian approach for model estimation....

## 2.9 Ethical Clearance
Ethical approval under clearance certificate number  was received from the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of the Witwatersrand. The certificate is in Appendix 1.
